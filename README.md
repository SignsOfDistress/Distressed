# Distressed
Small Minecraft Tweaks im testing. Will be released on Modrinth.com.
I honestly have NO IDEA What im going with this. I just wanted to make a mod because I was bored. I also wanted to tweak some things via my game because many mods on Modrinth don't work with how I would want them to.

Planned things:

Color Generator for Particles (Allowing particles to be read by color instead of default Minecraft tones.)
Auto Color Code in Chat. Instead of having to find color codes via google.
Crosshair Tweaks
Small bug fixes, fps.
